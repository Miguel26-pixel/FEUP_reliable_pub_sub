All things considered, the goal of developing a reliable publish-subscribe service using the ZeroMQ library, while guaranteeing the 'exactly once' message delivery, can be considered a success. After running different tests, the program seems to answer well to the various edge cases following the demanded requirements. 

One of the things that ended up being really positive was the chosen programming language. There was, at first, some doubt on this choice, given the overhead caused by the learning period of the language. However, after some time, this choice proved due to the quality of the language's compiler, making many of the tasks much easier than they would have been in other languages. 

In the end, the whole project was concluded successfully, and the system could be used reliably.
