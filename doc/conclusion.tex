All things considered, the goal of developing a reliable publish-subscribe service using the ZeroMQ library, while guaranteeing the 'exactly once' message delivery, can be considered a success. The latter specification can be considered one of the most challenging matters in the assignment, since it implied the use of different detail specifications and thought process to insure it. One of the things that ended up being really positive was the chosen programming language. In the beginning, the decision of writing the code in Rust did not carry many confidence, given the learning curve and the low knowledge about it from everyone. However, after some time, this choice proved to be valuable since many of the tasks would be much more difficult in other languages, which eased the work a lot. After running different tests, the program seems to answer well to the various edge cases following the demanded requirements. In the end, the whole project was concluded successfully, and the system could be used reliably and fault-proof.
