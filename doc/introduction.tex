The project proposed in SDLE class consists of a reliable publish-subscribe service that should come in the form of a library which provides 4 functions:

\begin{description}
    \item[subscribe] allows the user to subscribe to a topic
    \item[unsubscribe] allows the user to unsubscribe to the topic he was subscribed
    \item[get] allows a subscriber to fetch a message from a topic
    \item[put] allows the user to publish a message to a topic
\end{description}

The system developed should guarantee exactly-once delivery of its messages, except for some rare error conditions, which means, quoting the project's statement:

\begin{itemize}
    \item on successful return from put() on a topic, the service guarantees that the message will eventually be delivered "to all subscribers of that topic", as long as the subscribers keep calling get()
    \item on successful return from get() on a topic, the service guarantees that the same message will not be returned again on a later call to get() by that subscriber
\end{itemize}

In addition the project should be built using the \emph{libzmq} library, from \emph{ZeroMQ}. We chose to use the \emph{Rust}\footnote{\url{https://www.rust-lang.org/}} programming language to build our system, as it is well known for its security, reliability, speed and developer satisfaction, as well as having a libzmq binding available.
